## Introduction
What's an API? More importantly, how the heck do I use one? This is a simple repo of me trying to figure that out myself.

Basically, an API, or Application Program Interface, allows a program to access data from given servers. This is a request framework designed and documented so that other developers can utilize the data those servers have to offer.

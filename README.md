# What's An API (Documentation)
___

## Introduction
What's an API? More importantly, how the heck do I use one? This is a simple repo of me trying to figure that out myself.

Basically, an API, or Application Program Interface, allows a program to access data from given servers. This is a request framework designed and documented so that other developers can utilize the data those servers have to offer.

## Data Retrieved from these APIs
Below is the list of requested APIs in this project:
* [Giphy](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI)

##### TODO
* ~~Configure _git_ repo~~
* ~~Configure _require.js_~~
* ~~Backbone-ify~~
 * ~~Create a Backbone View for in _giphy.js_~~
* ~~Add [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)~~
 * ~~Make partial template to display search results nicely~~
* Restructure file system
 * ~~May 30, 2016~~
* Add [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* Giphy API
 * Bootstrap-ify search form
 * Add more form options for users to input giphy rating, returned results limit
 * Bootstrap-ify results (overall pretty-ness and add paging, too)

## External Libraries
These are loaded using Requirejs in the _requireconfig.js_ file in the root of the project.
* [Requirejs](http://requirejs.org/)
* [jquery](https://jquery.com/)
* [underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)
* [Backbone](http://backbonejs.org/)
* [Mustache](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js)
